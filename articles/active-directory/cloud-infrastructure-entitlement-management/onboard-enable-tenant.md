# Enable Permissions Management in your organization

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Entra Permissions Management is currently in PREVIEW.
> Some information relates to a prerelease product that may be substantially modified before it's released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.


> [!NOTE]
> The Permissions Management PREVIEW is currently not available for tenants hosted in the European Union (EU).



This article describes how to enable Permissions Management in your organization. Once you've enabled Permissions Management, you can connect it to your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) platforms.

> [!NOTE]
> To complete this task, you must have *global administrator* permissions as a user in that tenant. You can't enable Permissions Management as a user from other tenant who has signed in via B2B or via Azure Lighthouse.

## Prerequisites

To enable Permissions Management in your organization:

- You must have an Azure AD tenant. If you don't already have one, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- You must be eligible for or have an active assignment to the global administrator role as a user in that tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> During public preview, Permissions Management doesn't perform a license check.

## How to enable Permissions Management on your Azure AD tenant

1. In your browser:
    1. Go to [Azure services](https://portal.azure.com) and use your credentials to sign in to [Azure Active Directory](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview).
    1. If you aren't already authenticated, sign in as a global administrator user.
    1. If needed, activate the global administrator role in your Azure AD tenant.
    1. In the Azure AD portal, select **Features highlights**, and then select **Permissions Management**.

    1. If you're prompted to select a sign in account, sign in as a global administrator for a specified tenant.

        The **Welcome to Permissions Management** screen appears, displaying information on how to enable Permissions Management on your tenant.

1. To provide access to the Permissions Management application, create a service principal.

    An Azure service principal is a security identity used by user-created apps, services, and automation tools to access specific Azure resources.

    > [!NOTE]
    > To complete this step, you must have Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell on your system, or an Azure subscription where you can run Cloud Shell.

    - To create a service principal that points to the Permissions Management application via Cloud Shell:

        1. Copy the script on the **Welcome** screen:

            `az ad sp create --id b46c3ac5-9da6-418f-a849-0a07a10b3c6c`

        1. If you have an Azure subscription, return to the Azure AD portal and select **Cloud Shell** on the navigation bar.
            If you don't have an Azure subscription, open a command prompt on a Windows Server.
        1. If you have an Azure subscription, paste the script into Cloud Shell and press **Enter**.

            - For information on how to create a service principal through the Azure portal, see [Create an Azure service principal with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli).

            - For information on the **az** command and how to sign in with the no subscriptions flag, see [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index?view=azure-cli-latest#az-login&preserve-view=true).

            - For information on how to create a service principal via Azure PowerShell, see [Create an Azure service principal with Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/create-azure-service-principal-azureps?view=azps-7.1.0&preserve-view=true).

        1. After the script runs successfully, the service principal attributes for Permissions Management display. Confirm the attributes.

             The **Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management** application displays in the Azure AD portal under **Enterprise applications**.

1. Return to the **Welcome to Permissions Management** screen and select **Enable Permissions Management**.

    You have now completed enabling Permissions Management on your tenant. Permissions Management launches with the **Data Collectors** dashboard.

## Configure data collection settings

Use the **Data Collectors** dashboard in Permissions Management to configure data collection settings for your authorization system.

1. If the **Data Collectors** dashboard isn't displayed when Permissions Management launches:

    - In the Permissions Management home page, select **Settings** (the gear icon), and then select the **Data Collectors** subtab.

1. Select the authorization system you want: **AWS**, **Azure**, or **GCP**.

1. For information on how to onboard an AWS account, Azure subscription, or GCP project into Permissions Management, select one of the following articles and follow the instructions:

    - [Onboard an AWS account](onboard-aws.md)
    - [Onboard an Azure subscription](onboard-azure.md)
    - [Onboard a GCP project](onboard-gcp.md)
